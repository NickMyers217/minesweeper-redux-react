## ES6 Minesweeper

An implementation of Minesweeper using ES6, Redux, and functional programming. My goal with this project is to learn the ins and outs of managing an application's state using Redux. I've also used some basic features of React and it's Redux bindings to render the game to the DOM.

## Getting Started
You'll need the following things installed and avaliable in your path
- A recent version of Node.js
- A recent version of NPM

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickmyers217/minesweeper-redux-react
cd minesweeper-redux-react
npm install
npm run build
```

From there you can open ./public/index.html in your browser.
