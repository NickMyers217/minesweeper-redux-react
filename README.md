## ES6 Minesweeper

An implementation of Minesweeper using ES6, Redux, and functional programming. My goal with this project is to learn the ins and outs of managing an application's state using Redux. Eventually I'll bring in React to render the Redux store in the browser with various different components (DOM, canvas, webgl, etc...).


## Getting Started
You'll need the following things installed and avaliable in your path
- A recent version of Node.js
- A recent version of NPM

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickmyers217/minesweeper-redux-react
cd minesweeper-redux-react
npm install
npm run build
```

From there you can open ./public/index.html in your browser. There are several NPM scripts available while working with the project.
- npm run build will build the project
- npm run build:watch will build the project and continue to watch for changes
- npm run test will run all of the project unit tests
- npm run lint will use standard.js to show linting errors
